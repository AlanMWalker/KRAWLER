# KRAWLER Engine

# What is it?
A C++ wriitten 2D game engine written as a layer over SFML (found at : www.sfml-dev.org). This engine features an entity-component system, a small basic 2D impulse-resolution driven physics engine. A renderer capable of sprites, animation and tiledmaps. Even 2D lighting using our own raycast implementation is available. Planned features include support for LUA and a level editor which will be packages with the engine. 

# Why use it?
I don't expect large groups to use this engine. It is designed around my needs when developing my own 2D games using SFML, and it does a lot of things SFML doesn't. Documentation on how to use the engine can be found under the wiki, and all headers will include documentation by the new release featuring out entity-component system.

# Programmers involved:
Alan Masimba Walker
Sam Halme (input)
Joe Thomas (raycast & lighting)
